    <p>
      5.1 When you sign up or register, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a

    <p>
      6.2 We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably
      necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b)
      enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent,
      or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights,

      notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4 We may share with third party certain pieces of aggregated, non‐personal information such as the number of
      users who searched for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.
      Such information does not identify you individually.
    </p>
    <p>6.5 We may disclose the sensitive personal data or information:</p>

    <p>

      including cyber incidents, prosecution, and punishment of offences.
    </p>
    <p>7. Information security</p>
    <p>
      7.1 We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or unauthorized alteration,
      disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing
      practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to
      systems where we store personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2 We restrict access to personal information to Happy List employees, contractors and agents who need to know
      that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by
      confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if
      they fail to meet these obligations.
    </p>
    <p>8. Data integrity</p>
    <p>
      <b><a class="info-text" href="/" target="_blank">Happy List</a></b>
      processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy
      or any applicable service‐specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices
      to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our
      services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and
      current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
    </p>
    <p>9. Accessing and updating personal information</p>
    <p>
      When you use Happy List services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal
      information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is
      not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to
      identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such
      requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
      disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
      instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
      required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
      except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
    </p>
    <p>10. Enforcement</p>

    <p>
      11.1 Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this
      Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any
      Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice
      (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be
      identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior version of this Privacy
      Policy in an archive for your review.
